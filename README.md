# requack
Requack supports my software quality-control activities as a checklist maintenance tool

I define my software objects, their classes, and a checklist for each class, all in a single file.
I run the program which generates all the facts I want to be verified on all my objects.
Whenever I verify a fact for an object, I mark it as PASS in the file.

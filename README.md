# requack
Requack supports my software quality-control activities as a checklist maintenance tool.

I use Requack to make sure that the best practices are implemented in my software by following these steps:

I define my software objects, their classes and a checklist for each class - all in a single file.

I run the program which prints all the facts I want to be verified on all my objects.

Whenever I verify a fact for an object, I mark it as PASS in the file.
